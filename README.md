## What?

Here's an HTML mockup of the ChatGPT website UI. It's not meant to work like ChatGPT does--it's just the website layout, nothing more. This is a close-to-exact replica of the dark version of the ChatGPT 4o website. It uses the folded-in version of the sizebar and of course none of the links/buttons work at all. It's not responsive. It contains part of a random conversation I had with ChatGPT about flashing mechanical keyboard firmware.

## Why?

I needed a non-functional HTML mockup of the ChatGPT webpage for a personal project. I tried to get ChatGPT and Cursor to quickly generate this, but they weren't even coming close. They kept giving me generic chat interfaces, but I needed it to look exactly like ChatGPT. I couldn't find anything like that on GitHub, so I'm posting it here in case it saves someone, somewhere some time.

I had also tried opening ChatGPT and copy/pasting the source, but the filesize was massive, like over 1mb. And the markup was super messy for what I needed. I didn't want Tailwind, I didn't want divs with tons of CSS class names and I didn't want deeply nested divs for no reason. Just clean and simple HTML and CSS in as small a filesize as possible. In the end, it came out to 47kb. There's also a minified version here that's 42kb.

## Improvements?
There's certainly more work that could be done if you're a perfectionist. If someone wants to add light mode, add more codeblock syntax highlighting, add tooltips, make the sidebar open/close, make the links work, cross-browser test, etc feel free to do that and make a pull request. Otherwise I'll mostly likely leave this here as is. There might be some trickery one could do to get the filesize smaller still--feel free to take a stab at it and make a PR.
